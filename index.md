![Meet Me!](/assets/images/headshot.jpg)

#### My name is Abdulrahman Aldossary, or 'Abdul' in the English-speaking world. I recently obtained my Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, working under supervision of Martin Head-Gordon developing electronic structure methods. Please check my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XkLnFHMAAAAJ&hl=en) for published work or my [CV page](/CV/). 

#### In my free time I bike, hike, cook new dishes, listen to podcasts, and play video games. I love picking up new skills and hobbies and meeting new people. Reach out if you want to chat!
