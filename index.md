![Meet Me!](/assets/images/headshot.jpg)

#### My name is Abdulrahman Aldossary, or 'Abdul' in the English-speaking world. I am a postdoc at the University of Toronto working in the [Matter lab](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/) led by Prof. Al√°n Aspuru-Guzik. My current research interest is to investigate accelerating quantum chemistry calculations using machine learning and/or quantum computing. 

#### I obtained my Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, working with [Prof. Martin Head-Gordon](https://mhggroupberkeley.com/) developing electronic structure methods. Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XkLnFHMAAAAJ&hl=en) for published work or my [CV page](/CV/). 

#### In my free time I like to bike, hike, explore new dishes, listen to podcasts, and play video games. I love picking up new skills and hobbies and meeting new people. Reach out to chat!
