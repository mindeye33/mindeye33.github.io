<font size="+2"> 
My name is Abdulrahman Aldossary, and I go by Abdul in the English-speaking world. I recently obtained my Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, working under supervision of Martin Head-Gordon developing electronic structure methods. Please check my Google Scholar for published work, and get in touch with me if you're interested in ongoing research.
